There are three folders in this **platform** directory. They are **hyperledger-fabric**, **r3-corda** and **shared**. The **shared** folder contains various sub folders which in turn each has a certain type of files that will be used as **prerequisites**. Users then can run files in the **hyperledger-fabric** or **r3-corda** folder for running either a Hyperledger Fabric or R3 Corda platform depending on the users' decisions. 

For users new to this project, please go to the readme file in the **shared** folder first. For users who have already completed the **prerequisites**, they can go to either the **hyperledger-fabric** or **r3-corda** folder to read the specific readme file for more details of each platform.
